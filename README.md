# File Organizer

This Python script automatically organizes files from a specified source directory into categorized folders within a destination directory. It tracks file additions in real-time and moves them based on their file types, making file management simple and efficient.

## Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Tracks new files added to the source directory in real-time using `watchdog`.
- **Customizable File Organization**: Define your own categories and file types to suit your needs.
- **Automatic Folder Creation**: Creates destination folders as needed, so you donâ€™t have to.

## Recent Updates

In response to challenges encountered during the file monitoring process, I've enhanced the functionality to address permission errors caused by temporary file usage from browsers. The script now effectively organizes files directly from the source directory, ensuring smooth operation during downloads.
